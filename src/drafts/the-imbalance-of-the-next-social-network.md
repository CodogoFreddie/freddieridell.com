It's no secret that the current social media top-dogs aren't serving the public good.

## 1. User time spent on the service must not incur a cost on the developer.

"So what?" we thought, "I see more than 100 every day when I walk down the street, and it might be nice to see some adverts for stuff I'm more likely to buy!" But what so few of us realised is that _advertisers would get us addicted to walking down the street if they could, and websites are very easy to make addictive._ Money comes from adverts, the more you use a sight the more adds you see, social media have no capital incentive not get addict you to their platform.

All these problems stem back from the un-avoidable fact of a centralised system: **more users spending more time means more cost.** If every minute a user spends on your platform costs you money, you need to make every minute generate money as well. But now that every minute a user spends on your platform is generating money for you, you want them to spend as much time as possible on your platform.

1. Minutes cost Money
2. Minute must make money
3. Maximising minutes maximises Money
4. Addicting your users is your most profitable path

There are, obviously, ways to make money with a social platform other than building an advertising; but none as reliably scalable and profitable as advertising to your users. And when your costs increase with your success, it is imperative that you ensure your revenue does too. You are literally disincentivized to build a non-exploitative business model, lest you become a victim of your own success.

It needs the discoverability and scale of twitter: it's a good thing that someone can have 1000000 followers, it allows people who choose to to use it as a real marketing platform, and helps to democratise content
It needs the small scale management/administration/moderation of a single-topic forum: helps create a community with its own customs, and helps keep bad actors quarantined

The difficulty comes from joining these two conflicting ideals, how can we take the best from both? Who's doing this sort of thing already?
