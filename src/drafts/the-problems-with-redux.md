Redux is very clever, effective, and well designed. But unless you read all the docs and supporuting literature it's much easier to mis-understand than it is to understand. It's built on many familiar concepts, which means that developers are likely to mis-apply their old understandings to it. It makes its new ideas too accessable. Also: while it does solve it's problem really well: decoupling actions from their effects - 90% of the logic of 90% of apps is just CRUD, which redux handles perfectly well, but more verbosely that other methods. CRUD also doesn't utilise the power of redux, so developers are unused to utilising that power, and fail to use it when it really matters
