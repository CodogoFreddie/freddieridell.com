Title: Introverts have all the luck

---

A lot of noise of often made about how we aught to spend more time listening to introverts. How, if only the loud, shouty, domenering extroverts could stop monopolising conversation for a few minutes we as people and as a society would all have much to gain.

If I may present a counterpoint:

## Extroversion !== Comfortable in Social Situations
The distinction between extroverts and introverts is that extroverts gain energy from being around others, while introverts gain energy from being on their own. This is obviouly a spectrum, no one is 100% introverted or extroverted, and almost everyone needs some time in the setting their letss disposed towards.

What extroversion does not mean, is that you can just dive into each and every social situation that presents itself to you.

Over last summer, I was experiencing some mild social anxiety: social situations, and meeting new people filled me with a mild background unease that made it very hard to put myself out there and be my best self. However this didn't change the fact that spending time alone would run me down and leave me pretty depressed.

The thing that I needed to make myself happier: regular social interaction, was being made harder by my depresion, which was making it harder to engage in social situations which was making my depression worse.

## Oh the things I'd do!
Being comfortable being alone is a really useful skill, you can't constantly expect your fiance and friends to be avaialable to prop you up emotionally. I work in a 3 person company with iregular working hours, so there are often days that I spend enterly alone in the office.

I'm quite capable of working in an empty room for a few hours or so: I'm quite practiced at entering [flow state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWcapC-kriY) and I'm not lacking in motivation for my job or side-projects. But It's an undenable fact that working in an empty room for more than 3 hours leaves me worn out, sad, and feeling empty.

Being enterly comfortable on my own is such an alien concept to me. I'd love to be happy with no-one else around.

## No one's got it easy
None of this is to say that I'm asking to trade who I am for a more introverted version of myself. I like social situations, I enjoy being around others and talking to them.

But I think it's often easy to forget that the introvert/extrovert devide is not a strict +ve/-ve devide, extroversion is not a priceless gift, and introverts might not be the derided and putupon people that some might imagine them to be.
