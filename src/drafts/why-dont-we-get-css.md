CSS is so hard for you to wrap your head around because they've already made so many decisions for you, it enforces a great deal of pre-decided logic onto your layout so that the instruction set can be as minimal and terse as possible.

In HTML you can do pretty much anything you want, most elements can be the children of most other elements, trees can go as deep or as wide as you want. 
In JS you have a full programming language with 1000 ways to complete any given task, Javascript in peticular, is incredebly flexible.

If you're trying to position some boxes on a screen CSS comes with 90% of the work already done for you, all you need to do is give it the last little bit of instruction to get the job done.
