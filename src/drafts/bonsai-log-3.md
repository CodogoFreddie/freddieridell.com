title: Bonsai Log 3
---

A lot has happened since the last bonsai log update.

First off, my first bonsai is dead, kaput, pushing up daisies. I [had hoped](bonsai-log-2) that its leaves were falling off because winter was coming, but it's the end of May now and it's time to throw in the towel. It was a lovely little tree, and it will be missed, but I've not let my first failure stop me

## Weeping Willow

I took some clippings from the weeping willow in my parent's back garden, planted 4 of them, and had a total of 1 survive. I'm quite surprised that any survived, given the 3 days they spent traveling across London in a plastic bag before being planted.

I've re-potted the cutting into its own pot, with rather a disgusting disregard for aesthetics, and it's been growing along nicely. I'm planning to let it spend the rest of the summer growing and settling in, and maybe check how the roots are doing at the end of summer. I'm not very happy with how lopsided it is, so in a few year I expect to cut it right back and try to get it a bit more formally upright.

## Other Clippings

Last weekend I went for a walk in the part, and came back with 7 tree clippings. I've planted them all, kept them watered, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm fully expecting most of them not to make it, in fact I'm counting on it: I only have two pots spare to transplant the winners into.

I'm no arborist, so I only know what a few of these clippings actually are. Some of them had quite lovely flowers and I'm rooting for them to make it (though I know I shouldn't play favourites). Place your bets as to what species these are.
