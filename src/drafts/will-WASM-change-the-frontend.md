A lot of fuss has been made over the past few months about WASM, and how it is going to level the webapp development world by allowing you to write web apps in any language.

I'm exceited for this, but think it's a long way off.

What still makes JS so inviting as a front end language is also what makes it so irksome: It is wildly variable and can be forced into almost any shape

React isn't used because it's written in JS, React is used because it's brilliant, and React is possible because of JS.

No other mainstream language offers the extensibility of javascript, or allows you to work in so many different ways. Both through compilation with babel (allows for powerful code transforms), and runtime extension (allows for drop in environment alteration).

React hooks are a great example of this: a completly new and alient syntax, that appears to fundimentally alter the operation of the language, that's only requires you to bump 2 version numbers to use.

Until another language can show that it's equally updateable, customisable, and can wear as many hats, JS sill still rule
