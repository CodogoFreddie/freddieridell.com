				<Experience
					position="Senior React Contractor"
					biz="Workshare, Sharp Gaming"
					start={new Date("2018-02-18")}
				>
					<p>
						I have provided my development services for several
						clients, working as part of agile teams to deliver high
						quality web apps using modern react.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to development I have also trained junior
						team members, onboarded incoming mid/senior level
						developers, and driven foundational technical changes
						across codebases. I was trusted to investigate and
						implement the core state-management solution for a large
						scale green-field app, and drove an initiative to adopt
						state-of-the-art unit testing of an otherwise untested
						200k LOC codebase.
					</p>
				</Experience>

				<Experience
					position="Co-founder/Lead Developer"
					biz="Codogo"
					end={new Date("2018-02-18")}
					start={new Date(1451606400000)}
				>
					<p>
						The core focus of my work has been producing Codogo
						Write, a modern writing web app with a focus on
						ease-of-use and polished user experience. We were
						invited to pitch with Y Combinator in California on the
						strength of the MVP I developed
					</p>
					<p>
						To support development of this product, I produced
						complex web and native apps and websites for over 20
						clients, across a breadth of fields (including chat
						apps, social networks, and data-vis) both from scratch
						and on legacy systems in React and React Native
					</p>
				</Experience>

				<Experience
					position="Development Intern"
					biz="Amazon Instant Video"
					start={new Date(1433116800000)}
					end={new Date(1441065600000)}
				>
					<p>
						I worked on Amazonâ€™s native instant video player: a
						large scale real-time c++ codebase. I was responsible
						for porting it to OS X and fixing performance-critical
						memory bugs. Taking responsibility for mission-critical
						software and working to provide tooling for other
						developers allowed me to gain valuable experience in
						communicating with other developers across many other
						teams across Amazon
					</p>
				</Experience>

				<Experience
					position="Computer Science Degree (2:1)"
					biz="Durham University"
					start={new Date("2013-09-01")}
					end={new Date(1451606400000)}
				>
					<p>
						Dissertation: Designing, evaluating, and optimizing a
						system for population simulation
					</p>
					<p>
						During my degree I studied a wide range of subjects:
						from runtime/space analysis and higher order logic to
						database systems and software development best
						practices. My exposure to the full range of modern
						software at a world renowned university provided me with
						the rock solid foundation I needed to hit the ground
						running providing elegant and powerful solutions to
						every problem I've encountered since
