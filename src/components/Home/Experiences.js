			<p>
				I worked as a senior team-member working to modernize one of Workshare's core products: producing a
				greenfield react app built on an existing API
			</p>
			<p>
				I was instrumental in making major decisions during the development: technical choices and policy
				decisions that were foundational to the app as a whole. I was also trusted to provide training to other
				members of the team to bring them up to speed with react best practices.

				The core focus of my work has been producing Codogo Write, a state-of-the-art writing web app with a
				focus on ease-of-use and polished user experience. We were invited to pitch with Y Combinator in
				California on the strength of the MVP I developed
			</p>
			<p>
				To support development of this product, I produced complex web and native apps and websites for over 20
				clients, across a breadth of fields (including chat apps, social networks, and data-vis) both from
				scratch and on legacy systems in React and React Native

				I worked on Amazonâ€™s native instant video player: a large scale real-time c++ codebase. I was
				responsible for porting it to OS X and fixing performance-critical memory bugs. Taking responsibility
				for mission-critical software and working to provide tooling for other developers allowed me to gain
				valuable experience in communicating with other developers across many other teams across Amazon

				ground running providing elegant and powerful solutions to every problem I've encountered since
