			<p>
				I worked as a senior team-member working to modernize one of
				Workshare's core products: producing a greenfield react app
				built on an existing API.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was instrumental in making major decisions during the
				development: technical choices and policy decisions that were
				foundational to the app as a whole. I was also trusted to
				provide training to other members of the team to bring them up
				to speed with react best practices.{" "}

				The core focus of my work has been producing Codogo Write, a
				state-of-the-art writing web app with a focus on ease-of-use and
				polished user experience. We were invited to pitch with Y
				Combinator in California on the strength of the MVP I developed.
			</p>
			<p>
				To support development of this product, I produced complex web
				and native apps and websites for over 20 clients, across a
				breadth of fields (including chat apps, social networks, and
				data-vis) both from scratch and on legacy systems in React and
				React Native.

				I worked on Amazonâ€™s native instant video player: a large scale
				real-time c++ codebase. I was responsible for porting it to OS X
				and fixing performance-critical memory bugs. Taking
				responsibility for mission-critical software and working to
				provide tooling for other developers allowed me to gain valuable
				experience in communicating with other developers across many
				other teams across Amazon.

				During my degree I studied a wide range of subjects: from

				the full range of modern software at a world renowned university
				provided me with the rock solid foundation I needed to hit the
				ground running providing elegant and powerful solutions to every
				problem I've encountered since.
