I made this as a Christmas present for my fianc√©, it was originally meant to be a dragon, but it came out looking a bit too goofy.

The body was made with circular knitting, 2/3 moss stitch, 1/3 ribbed.

I was particularly proud of the eyes, they're made from one continuous piece of knitting: no sewing needed.

I stuffed them with small bits of stuffing, and sewed two layered buttons on for eyes.
