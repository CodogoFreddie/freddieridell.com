![Snakey](Snakey1)

I made this as a Christmas present for my fianc√©, it was originally meant to be a dragon, but it came out looking a bit too goofy.

![Snakey's Belly](Snakey2)

The body was made with circular knitting, 2/3 moss stitch, 1/3 ribbed.

![Snakey's Head](Snakey3)

I was particularly proud of the eyes, they're made from one continuous piece of knitting: no sewing needed.

![Snakey's Eye Back](Snakey4)

I stuffed them with small bits of stuffing, and sewed two layered buttons on for eyes.

![Snakey's Eye Front](Snakey5)
