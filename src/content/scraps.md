 Over the last two years I've been the primary developer responsible for designing, building, and maintaining over 20 React web and React Native apps. I've managed a team of 3 developers in their front-end development work. As part of this work I spearheaded and oversaw the development of a toolkit of reusable visual and functional components to ease code reuse and ensure a visually consistent look-and-feel over our suite of apps.

 I've been solely responsible for designing, developing, deploying and managing our full backend system; primarily built on AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 and Route53. Having developed both REST and GraphQL backends I feel comfortable working with a wide array of backend frameworks and methodologies.

 I also created a toolkit of reusable scripts for performing various tasks shared across our projects: building/developing with webpack/babel. I wrote the config for webpack and babel myself to ensure it was optimally tailored to our use-case.

 In one of our larger 3rd-party projects: a pintrest-like app with a Geo-referencing element, I worked with the Google Places API, to query information about businesses and points-of-interest around a set of coordinates. I also wrote companion software to scrape supplementary metadata from businesses' websites when that data was not available on Google Places.
