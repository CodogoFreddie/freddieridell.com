Wren is a dinky little scripting language that I've taken a strong interest in. It is class based, byte-code interpreted, very fast, and has cooperative multi-tasking at its core. It was created by the venerable [Bob Nystrom][bob]. I've authored various open source wren packages, including:

-   [semver][wrensemver]: For SemVer parsing and comparing.
-   [mesh][wrenmesh]: For working with the `.obj` mesh format.
-   [chorus][wrenchorus]: For parsing and delegating CLI arguments.
-   [tree][wrentree]: For pretty printing tree structures.
-   [tempo][wrentempo]: A date Library.
-   [stream proposal][wrenstreamproposal]: A proposal for introducing streams to the language.
