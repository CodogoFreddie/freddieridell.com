Wren is a dinky little scripting language that I've taken a strong interest in. It is class based, byte-code interpreted, very fast, and has cooperative multi-tasking at its core. It was created by the venerable [Bob Nystrom][bob]. I've authored various open source wren packages, including:

+ [semver][wrenSemver]: For SemVer parsing and comparing.
+ [mesh][wrenMesh]: For working with the `.obj` mesh format.
+ [chorus][wrenChorus]: For parsing and delegating CLI arguments.
+ [tree][wrenTree]: For pretty printing tree structures.
+ [tempo][wrenTempo]: A date Library.
+ [stream proposal][wrenStreamProposal]: A proposal for introducing streams to the language.
