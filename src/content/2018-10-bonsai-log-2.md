Today I did a bit of light pruning, apparently they can be pruned at the start and end of the growing season. It had a lot of growth at the top of the tree, disproportionate to the sides, so I needed to take a few of the leaves off the top to make it look more even.

There were also a few branches getting a bit too crossed over each other and tangled up, so I nipped off the ones with the fewest leaves.

I'm a little nervous about trimming the tree down, it feels a bit dangerous to take 5 leaves from a tree that's only got 100. But the internet says that a bonsai can loose up to 1/3rd of it's leaves in a pruning and be ok...

we'll see...
