# The 10 Code Commandments

## 1 CPU time is cheaper than developer time

## 2 Every function is a public API

## 3 Code is primarily to be read and written by other HUMANS

## 4 Code is primarily to be read and written by OTHER humans

## 5 [Duplication is cheaper than the Wrong Abstraction][dontalwaysdry]

## 6 If you're adding a feature, add a feature; if you're improving the code, improve the code

If the aim of a task is to create a feature, prioritise that feature over changing the codebase to better accomidate the feature. Once you've validated that the feature was a good feature you can (and should) then improve it's implementation, even by changing its API.
