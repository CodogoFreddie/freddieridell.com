# E Voting

Hi David,

Congratulations on your landslide victory in the last election, and your continued excellent work in my community. I'm very happy with your stance on every issue I've seen you encounter, and believe that you represent me very well.

I'm writing to you about an issue that is not imminently troubling, but that I fear could become a serious problem at very short notice: _Electronic Voting_

+ never trust anyone involved
+ same amount of effort to change 10000 as 1
+ check that the voting machine has the correct software installed
+ can tamper with a machine: imagine having to tell your vote to someone standing in the ballot room
+ electronic counting machine has the same floors
