title: It's ok to be crazy

---

__Outline__:

+ I acepted long that there shouldn't be any stigma arround mental health
+ Don't project any stigma outwards to others
+ Did project it internally
	+ That's a much harder burden to overcome
	+ Knew I was depressed, couldn't address it because it wouldn't confront it
