Our hero finds a magical item: `5 Gold Rings`, that gives them the power of a _Super Strength Punch_. They use this power for fighting in school, getting into brawls and such. Then they encounter another, with a magical item similar to their own: `A Partridge In A Pear Tree`; which... I don't know... they use as a bat or something.

Our hero defeats the challenger, taking their magical item, beginning a quest to find and own all 12 of the magical items; including:

+ `10 Lords A Leaping`: Super Jump
+ `7 Swans a Swimming`: Magically Good Swimming
+ `11 Pipers Piping`: The Pipers play beautiful songs that create Illusions.
