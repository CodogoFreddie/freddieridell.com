Since dropbox ruined all my dotfiles for the third time, I've since started storing them on [github][dotfiles]. This repo contains my config for:

- [`git`][git]: Various configs, aliass and functions
- [`zsh`][zsh]: Aliass, functions, and my own custom command line prompt. Heavily inspired by [oh my zsh][omz]
- [`i3`][i3]: A tiling window manager, which I find far easier to use than a floating windowing manager.
- [`task`][task]: A CLI for task management, a TODO list on unix steroids.
- [`nvim`][nvim]: A modern rewrite of vim.
- [`lemonbar`][lemonbar]: A tool for creating your own status bar.

As well as various other programs and tools that I use day-to-day.
