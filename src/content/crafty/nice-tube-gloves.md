I made these for an ex-girlfriend as a present. They're made from Merino wool.

I didn't follow a pattern for them, and instead just made them up as I went along; because of that, one of them is slightly bigger than the other.

They were made as a flat strip, then sewn up into a tube with a 2 inch overlap, to give the illusion that they could be unbuttoned.
